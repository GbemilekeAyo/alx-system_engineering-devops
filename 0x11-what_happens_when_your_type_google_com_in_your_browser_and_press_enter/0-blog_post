What happens when you type google.com in your browser?

When one types google.com and presses enter, the browser takes several steps, which can be as follows:
. Resolves the IP address of the URL via DNS
. Generate an HTTP request with headers (user-agent, cookie, accept)
. Open an HTTP connection to the resolved IP address
. Send the request to the server
. Receive the response from the server
. Parse response headers
. Perform additional operations depending on the response header
. Decompress the response body if it's compressed
. Parse the HTML code inside the response body
. Resolves any additional resources (Scripts, Images, etc)
. Start loading those resources via their URLs using the same steps
. Render the HTML as soon as the required resources are loaded, and continue loading the remaining resources in the background.
